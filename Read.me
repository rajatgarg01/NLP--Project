1. Import Required Libraries:
 Libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas, spacy, syllapy, and TextBlob are
imported to handle web scraping, text analysis, and data processing.

2. Loading and Reading Excel Files:
 The input Excel file (Input.xlsx) is read using pandas to extract URLs for web
scraping.
 The program loops through each row in the Excel file, sends HTTP requests to the
URLs, and extracts relevant data (like title, date, and content) using BeautifulSoup.

3. Text Extraction from Web Pages:
 For each URL, the script uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract content
such as the title, date, and body text. If the elements aren't found, default messages
like "Title not found" are returned.
4. Saving Extracted Data to Text Files:
 Each web page's extracted data is written to a .txt file using Python's open() function.
The filename is based on the URL_ID from the Excel file.

5. Natural Language Processing and Text Analysis:
 Using spaCy, syllapy, and TextBlob, various linguistic metrics are calculated from the
text files. These metrics include:
▪ Sentiment Analysis (positive/negative scores, polarity, subjectivity)
▪ Readability (average sentence length, Fog Index, percentage of complex
words)
▪ Linguistic Features (syllables per word, word count, personal pronouns)

6. Storing Results in DataFrames:
 A pandas DataFrame is built from the extracted metrics. Each row corresponds to a
text file, and each column holds a calculated metric.

7. Merging Results with Base Data:
 After generating the analysis, the results are merged with an existing structure
(Output Data Structure.xlsx) containing URL_ID and URL. The final results are
saved into an Excel file (Final Output.xlsx).

Explanation of the Approach
• Web Scraping: You use the requests library to retrieve web pages and BeautifulSoup to
extract specific HTML elements (like the title, date, and content). This allows you to gather
unstructured data for analysis.
• Text Processing: For the textual data, you leverage several techniques:
o Sentiment Analysis: The TextBlob library is used to compute the text's polarity
(positive/negative sentiment) and subjectivity scores.

o Linguistic Features: Functions like calculate_avg_sentence_length,
calculate_percentage_of_complex_words, and others extract various readability and
complexity metrics using spaCy and syllapy.

• Data Handling: You integrate Excel inputs and outputs using pandas. This ensures the
processed text data is saved in a structured, easily accessible format.
• Automation: The script processes multiple URLs, extracts data, performs complex analysis,
and then saves the results into multiple files, making it reusable for many web pages.
